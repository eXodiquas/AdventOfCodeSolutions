# Advent of Code Solutiuons

A collection of [Advent of Code (AoC)](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions (probably most of them are in Common Lisp). AoC is a yearly event where we solve daily coding puzzles starting from December 1st and ending December 25th. I did many of the recent ones, but now I want to solve the old ones aswell. Starting from 2015 working slowly to the current year. The goal is to solve every puzzle.

## Progress
